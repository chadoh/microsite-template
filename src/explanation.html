<p>
  This is a microsite initialized from
  <a href="https://github.com/chadoh/microsite-template">chadoh/microsite-template</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The entire production site is one minified file with few (if any)
  JS dependencies, but the development version uses nice tooling and
  multiple files.
</p>
<p>This is great for making explainer websites or other simple sites.</p>
<p>
  These sites can also easily be hosted for free on GitHub. For more
  info, see the README files in the root and the <code>docs</code>
  folder, as well as <code>scripts</code> in <code>package.json</code>.

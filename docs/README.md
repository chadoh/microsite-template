Don't edit these files!
=======================

GitHub makes it easy to deploy a static site from the `docs` folder on the
`master` branch.

This project doesn't need docs, but it is nice to keep the auto-generated
`index.html` file out of the project root, where it would be oh-so-tempting to
edit it there, rather than edit the source `index.html` that lives in the
`src` folder.

So! The `index.html` file in this folder is auto-generated. That's the one that
shows up as the website. Don't edit it directly!
